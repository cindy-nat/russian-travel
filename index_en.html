      <p class ="intro__text">According to held polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their home country.
        They do not understand what they have not seen here? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with sea in the south, dense forests
        Sayan and severe ice of the Putorana plateau.
        And you can also see all these beauties without millions on your account, a passport and many hours of flights.
        For example, Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother who took her three children, put them in her "Lada" and drove 20 thousand kilometers through her country.
        We have selected and described some interesting places which are worth for your vacation.</p>

        <p class="place__paragraph"> Curonian Spit is a 98-kilometre (61 mi) long, thin, curved sand-dune spit that separates the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea coast.
          Its southern portion lies within Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia and its northern within southwestern KlaipÄ—da County, Lithuania.</p>
        <p class="place__paragraph">The Kaliningrad region does not end there. For the traveler and explorer, in the same neighborhood - the westernmost point of Russia,
          the Baltic Spit - and the German heritage of the placer of small coastal cities.
          The atmosphere of these places excludes noisiness, plunging into the tranquility of nature and the smell of the steel, cool sea.</p>

        <p class="place__paragraph">You may have watched Zvyagintsev and even heard the history of the Arctic festival in Teriberka.
          Perhaps the word "Khibiny" did not remain under the snow of school memories of geography lessons.
          Perhaps you were not interested in a super-deep studying the earth's crust, and apatites have long covered you with apathy.
          But your dream of seeing the northern lights is going to come true with buying a ticket to Murmansk.</p>

        <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia.
          First of all because of the mountains: if you go along the ridge, you will see slopes covered with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes.
          And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places - the mountain air.</p>
        <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is moderate, so it is better to go here in summer.
          This way you will be able to see all the variety of local flora and fauna.
          Elk roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains.
          And the famous Pallas' cat are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory</p>

        <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, this all is true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for skiing competitions.
          This is a sport where the skier is tied to the motorcycle and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice.
          In March 2019, a world record of 197.011 km / h was set at the Baikal Mile festival.</p>

        <p class="place__paragraph">Siberia ends not in the Urals, but in Karelia: the Siberian larch that forms the taiga does not grow west of Vodlozero.
          But here it grows up to 30 meters - the forests of the Karelian national parks have never known an ax because of the impenetrable swamps.
          Some pines are more than half a millennium old.
          Touch a living creature that has seen the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it.
          In the virgin forest for a hundred kilometers you will not find a trail. And on rare paths, trees are marked with bear claws.
          So that everyone knows who is the boss here.</p>
